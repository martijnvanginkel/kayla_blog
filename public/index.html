                            <p style="margin-top: 10px">
                                At Boven’t IJ, a popular shopping center in Amsterdam Noord, it appears to be a regular afternoon. However, the presence of COVID -19 strikes us at the sight of many – and many not – wearing face masks.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The clear dissensus on face masks is visible just over a month after the Dutch government switched its official position to “strongly advise” people to wear face masks in public. While they have been required on public transportation since June 1, 2020, a strict requirement for wearing masks in public areas has not been mandated by the Dutch government. Currently,  a mask-wearing mandate cannot be legally enforced because of legislative limitations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In response to this confusion, the Dutch government declared on its website that: “Following a parliamentary debate… there is broad support for issuing clear national advice on the wearing of face masks in indoor public spaces.” This includes stores, restaurants, theatres and stations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That being said, why did the “strong” recommendation to wear face masks come so late? Tighter mask requirements in crowded public spaces (indoors and outdoors) have been the norm in other European countries, including Dutch neighbors Germany, France and Belgium. Though many others have not implemented nationwide mask-wearing mandates, they do require masks to be worn in certain public spaces. Conflicting stances on scientific evidence underlie the tension in the Netherlands as the government’s initial response to the pandemic went against the grain of the general approach. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Dutch apprehension initially derives from advice given by the director of the RIVM (National Institute for Public Health and Environment), Jaap van Dissel. Making his stance clear at the onset of the pandemic, van Dissel has maintained that face masks have “an exceptionally small effect” in preventing the spread of COVID-19. He emphasizes that maintaining at least a 1.5 meter distance is much more effective than face masks alone. His stance on masks is claimed to stem from the fear that the widespread “use of masks would dilute the basic rules” by providing a false sense of security from COVID-19. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The government’s fickle stance has sparked a fiery response from Van Dissel, who claims that any advice by the Dutch government to wear face masks stems from political motivation and not from evidence or the RIVM.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Outbreak Management Team (OMT) formed by the RIVM, in charge of the national efforts against COVID-19, took this stance a few steps further. As detailed in an official document dated July 28, 2020, the OMT states that, “undisputed evidence that non-medical face masks protect against the spread of COVID-19 is missing.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Of the two polar takes on mask-wearing recommendations, the RIVM’s stance has gradually aligned itself with that of international public health experts, who continue to strongly recommend the use of face masks in addition to other measures. The World Health Organization (WHO) says that, “Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to suppress transmission and save lives; the use of a mask alone is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of protection against COVID-19.” The WHO lists wearing face masks as a supplement to the already well-established measures against COVID-19, which the RIVM now seems to agree with.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While there is dissonance in the government, many members of the Dutch population have complied with the recommendation to wear face masks in public. Frederique, 23, was one of the customers at the Boven’t IJ shopping center who did not mind following the regulations. Frederique expressed that she started wearing a face mask following  the recommendation of the government, “I think I started [wearing a mask] around September, something like that. Before I actually didn’t really because it wasn’t recommended and I wasn’t really seeing people wearing it a lot.” She adds that she wears a face mask when she’s in a store or going grocery shopping but does not wear one when she is outside. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Meanwhile, others like Yannis, 33, are only willing to wear a mask when it’s mandatory. When asked if he wears a face mask often, he said, “not so much in public” and believes that “it is not that healthy.” However, his job in the hospitality sector requires him to wear one for at least 8 hours a day which, according to him, is “very annoying”. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Regardless of these signs of discomfort, the Dutch government appears to be moving ahead with the integration of mask-wearing into its measures against COVID-19. From December 1, 2020 a requirement mandating the wearing of face masks in indoor public spaces has come into effect. Failure to comply with this measure will result in a 95 euro fine.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This trajectory is one that is much needed. While the number of daily coronavirus cases continues to decrease in the aftermath of a surge, the pandemic is nowhere near its end. Experts are particularly anxious about how much compliance will be observed during the holiday season. The previous upheaval of cases in the Netherlands featured a peak of 11,059 new cases in a day. Whether or not this shocked the government into attempting a new approach, it is clear that they hope this new requirement will provide an additional layer of protection in these volatile times.
                            </p>

                            <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-weight: bold;">
                                Individual behavior predicted by computer algorithms, social discord, and the demise of modern democracy are how The Social Dilemma, a documentary produced by Netflix, presents the ways in which our lives have become dominated by social media. The documentary paints a particularly dismal picture in which we are living in “the age of disinformation” while our behaviors and interests are predicted by out-of-control social media algorithms. The world is depicted as deeply politically polarized as society grapples with the problems of disinformation and echo chambers. The Social Dilemma depicts legitimate consequences of social media but falls short in presenting an accurate and nuanced understanding of these issues. The big question is, to what extent does social media play into these outcomes?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dr. Michael Hameleers, an assistant professor of Political Communication and Journalism at the University of Amsterdam and an expert in disinformation, offers a more nuanced understanding of social media and its consequences. 
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-weight: bold;">
                                Reality or exaggerated reality?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The titular ‘dilemma’ suggested by the documentary, according to Dr. Hameleers, is, “not really a dilemma” in the traditional sense, “but more of a one-sided [argument] that the world is going to end because of platforms and social media”. In fact, the world has seen disinformation and propaganda campaigns since the past, but “because of some of the affordances of social media, some of these challenges have become… more visible.” While the prevalence of social media has brought along negative consequences, Dr. Hameleers points out that social media and more broadly, the internet, have been beneficial in promoting investigative journalism platforms and discussions among citizens.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Social Dilemma paints a shallow view of the relationship between social media users and platforms. The documentary depicts a relationship in which social media platforms provide information that users blindly consume. They simulate that users just consume the information that is presented to them and are non-critical and lack agency. However, Dr. Hameleers explains that in the documentary, “they don’t really pay attention to the receiver’s side… [people] are also critical.” Ultimately, social media users are not as uncritically passive to information they encounter; even though, “some people may be less critical than others and may be more likely to believe what confirms their gut feeling,” they do not only “reassure their own reality on social media.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Rashida Richardson of the NYU School of Law/AI Now Institute expresses during the documentary that: “We are all operating on a different set of facts. When that happens at scale you’re no longer able to reckon with or even consume information that contradicts with that world view you’ve created.” The phenomenon that she refers to is an echo chamber, which according to Dr. Hameleers has been studied in communication science literature for about the past 100 years. While he acknowledges that social media may amplify bias in selecting information that constructs a specific reality, he argues that people do not live in separate realities based on different truths; “It [social media] may stimulate this process that people can select their own reality, but people are still critical to some extent.” 
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-weight: bold;">
                                Real-life consequences of disinformation
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Though social media users tend to consume a more diverse media diet with different perspectives—even if it’s slightly skewed to one side—Dr. Hameleers expresses concern over the current state of disinformation: “I think disinformation has real life consequences. Even if we take into account 90% of people may never hold these beliefs, the 10% that holds them and maybe 1% of them that actually acts upon them is quite dangerous as you do see it can have offline consequences.” While disinformation is not far-reaching, it still creates the potential to sow societal discord on a larger scale.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even though most people will not only exclusively see fake news online, research suggests that people are generally unable to differentiate between quality journalism and disinformation. Dr. Hameleers has found this in his own research: “If you simply get a real news article in an experiment and put it alongside a disinformation article, the credibility scores do not differ that much between those categories… You especially see that when false content realigns or aligns with people’s prior views or political ideologies you indeed see it’s more convincing.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The documentary cites research from the Pew Center that political polarization between Democrats and Republicans in the United States is at a 20-year high and implies that social media use has contributed to this observed polarization. Dr. Hameleers clarifies that this relationship between political polarization and social media use cannot be classified as causal: “I think that we cannot really only attribute it to the cause of social media because people, their perceptions, have also become more extreme and I don’t know if it’s entirely because of social media, but also maybe due to shifts in the political landscape, economy, there are many different factors that may also play a role in that.” Social media, among many other different societal forces, has contributed to this increase in polarization, but social media alone, according to communication science experts, does not cause polarization.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-weight: bold;">
                                Optimism for the future
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While the presence, even if it is small, of disinformation and echo chambers on social media poses a legitimate threat to the well-being of democracy, Dr. Hameleers holds a rather optimistic viewpoint that interventions such as fact-checking and media literacy training can mitigate the negative consequences of social media. Research has suggested that fact-checking is an effective way to stop the spread of disinformation but it “sometimes comes after the harm is done so it already might have cultivated misperceptions” because not everyone who is exposed to disinformation is also exposed to corrections. In addition to fact-checking, more structural interventions such as media-literacy training are necessary so that people can learn how to identify disinformation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While Dr. Hameleers is optimistic in current empirically-supported interventions against disinformation, he points out that interventions must be expanded and tailored to the needs of different demographics because research assumes that, “everyone would accept fact-checkers and would accept these media literacy trainings,” even though these may not be appropriate for those that are most vulnerable to disinformation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                More long-term solutions such as promoting quality journalism and teaching media literacy in schools may be most effective in preventing the spread of disinformation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although The Social Dilemma depicts social media as a sphere of disinformation, many users in real life seem to trust social media less than legacy media such as television news. Research from 2018 by the Edelman Trust Barometer shows that only 24% of people surveyed in the UK trusted social media to get news while 61% trusted legacy media for getting news. These sentiments have been echoed throughout the coronavirus pandemic, according to Dr. Hameleers, with a substantial number of people that “trust TV news… as their most trusted source.” So while the legitimate threats of social media are still very much present, the public is attuned to these threats.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Overall, when asked about combating the threat of disinformation on social media, Dr. Hameleers says that, “it’s not just that social media operates in a vacuum and it’s all threatening us and there’s no other supply of information anymore because there is, and people still trust that. So I’m optimistic.”
                            </p>

George Floyd was one of the many Black Americans killed by police officers in the United States. His death has catalyzed the re-emergence of the Black Lives Matter in the United States and all over the world. Individuals, organizations, and businesses alike have all begun to take pronounced stances against police brutality and white supremacy. However, while many rush to announce their newfound affinity to racial justice some have​ ​questioned the true intentions​ of many brands: do they really care for racial justice or are they just doing what is trendy (on and offline). This leaves the question, ​how does an organization (social justice oriented or not) demonstrate its position in regards to all social justice issues, including racial justice?​ The answer is to take an intersectional approach—which may be easier said than done.

                                What is intersectionality?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Intersectionality,​ a theory developed by Black-Feminist scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw, is a lens used to analyze multiple facets of social injustice--especially in regards to identity—at the same time. An intersectional approach deviates from a​ ​“single-axis framework​”​ ​of understanding individual identities by incorporating, for example, race, gender, and class in analyzing individual identities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Previously, intersectionality was a term in academic circles, but today it is used by many involved in social justice efforts. As a public relations professional, you may ask yourself, “what does intersectionality have to do with creating a more inclusive brand/organization?”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Scholars argue that​, in today’s day and age, promoting and supporting social justice movements via social media cannot be separated from intersectionality. By openly advocating for a particular cause on social media, the public is able to engage with organizations and offer criticism or praise for their efforts. This forces brands/organizations to be intentional with their words and actions otherwise they may risk losing credibility.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                                How can your brand/organization become intersectional?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Intersectionality in public relations has been traditionally used to analyze the lack of diversity in the workforce. However, it is important to consider how intersectionality can be used to improve the public relations strategy of a brand/organization. Though it is important to note that intersectionality is not merely a communications strategy, but it is a way to evaluate, un-make, and re-make your brand/organization. If you and your brand/organization are ready to genuinely embrace genuine advocacy, use the following suggestions to improve your intersectional PR strategy:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                1. Don’t be afraid to take a stance. Being an intersectional brand/organization means that you must take a clear stance. It is important to produce clear advocacy communication that is consistent with the intersectional stance that you are taking. This means that there is no room to “play the middle” and that you and your brand/organization must be transparent and completely honest. While this may sound scary because, of course, taking a strong stance for anything political may appear to be a potential source of damage for your brand/organization, evidence suggests that it may actually have the opposite effect. Nike saw a​ ​31% increase in profits​ after running a controversial advertising campaign featuring football player and activist Colin Kaepernick. It is important to build a brand that is consistent with your organization and its values because genuineness makes you unique and relatable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                2. Self-reflect. Building an intersectional brand/organization first requires some individual and brand/organization-level introspection. It is crucial that your brand/organization “practices what it preaches” when embracing an intersectional approach. How does your brand/organization deal with social injustice? Is the workforce diverse? Do intra-brand/company initiatives reflect those that you portray to the outside world? In this way, intersectionality is not just a communication strategy but it is the guiding structure of the brand/organization. How can you be genuine if your brand/organization does not represent what it is advocating for? This could include hiring initiatives, ensuring an inclusive and safe working space, and recognizing and embracing individual differences among colleagues.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                3. Be willing to adapt and change. Just as Rome was not built in a day, it is important to understand that becoming a brand/organization that practices intersectionality is a process and it must be done in conversation with your audience. Before social media, brands/organizations were able to cultivate centralized strategic messaging, but now as many brands/organizations are vastly present on social media strategic messaging may no longer be centralized. This means that brands/organizations should build their communication strategy around being reflexive, which includes being transparent, acknowledging past failures, and clearly addressing how the brand/organization can move forward.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                                Where to go from here:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As times are changing, audiences have set much higher expectations for brands and organizations; consumers require transparency and social responsibility. If you want your brand/organization to keep up then it is time to adopt an intersectional public relations strategy. To be an intersectional brand/organization is to be bold, self-reflective, and reflexive. It is clear that modern day public relations is not just about sending a carefully crafted message, but it is about living those ideals out in practic​e.

                            </div>
                        </div>

                            A city known for its abundance of bicycles has become equally known for its bustling tourism and crowded city center. Often, Amsterdammers ring their bike bells at tourists who find themselves blocking bike lanes and roads. Cyclists, dodging tourists who are unfamiliar with such a prominent cycling infrastructure, are often annoyed with tourists as they associate them with a crowded city center that is impossible to bike through. But, the association of tourists as the main source of congestion in the city center may be a false equivalence. The true culprit is the number of cars driving through narrow roads that were clearly not built for cars.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            However, despite the atrocities brought on by the COVID 19 pandemic, Amsterdammers have been able to find a silver lining: their streets are clear, the city is peaceful, and there is less noise. But, the obvious absence of tourists is not the only explanation for the improved accessibility of Amsterdam by locals. The absence of cars had arguably created more space for residents to roam and reclaim their streets. Cars, not tourists, are the greatest culprits of congestion in Amsterdam. City congestion, a nuisance to residents, is not the only reason Amsterdam should ditch cards.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Evidence shows that a decrease in road and air traffic could explain a decrease between 20-60% in CO2 emissions during the month of March. While fewer Dutch people were driving in compliance with stay-at-home orders, there was an improvement in air quality.  In 2019, the city of Amsterdam announced that it would ban gasoline and diesel powered cars and motorcycles beginning in 2030. The city’s current plan cites air quality as the main reason for initiating a car ban. We can see that the response to following stay-at-home instructions unintentionally reflected this very goal to decrease auto emissions. Auto emissions, which contribute to poor air quality only further exacerbate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Research shows that patients who live in an area with poorer air quality are more likely to die from the coronavirus. A swift ban on vehicles in the city center would especially make sense, in the short-term, given the relationship between poor air quality and coronavirus-related deaths.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            According to Amsterdam’s city traffic counselor, Sharon Dijksma, Amsterdammers’ lives are cut short by 1 year because of poor air quality, but cars also occupy limited, valuable space in Amsterdam. Not only do cars have negative implications for our health, but they occupy limited, valuable space in Amsterdam. Europeans, in general, want to reclaim their city’s streets from cars: A poll from politico found that, on average, 64% of European residents did not want to return to levels of pollution pre-pandemic. A car ban provides relief from air pollution and more space for residents to roam safely in their cities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The reclamation of city space from cars has been happening all over the world in an attempt to create more outdoor space for safe social distancing since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Cities such as Milan, Rome, Berlin, and New York, among many others, have all committed to expanding cycling infrastructure and prioritizing pedestrians and cyclists over cars. While Amsterdam already has an expansive cycling infrastructure with 515km of cycling lanes in the city, it is important that the city continues to class cyclists and pedestrians above cars.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The city of Amsterdam should implement its car ban immediately and should include all personal automobiles, not just gas and diesel vehicles. There are, obviously, some exceptions that should be made: people with disabilities who rely on personal vehicles to transport themselves should have access to permits that would allow personal vehicle use.  Additionally, delivery, construction, and commerce-related vehicles would also be able to access the city center. The current ban that allows electric vehicles gives a pass to wealthy city dwellers that can afford to switch to electric. Instead, this ban should be extensive so that Amsterdam’s narrow streets, which were never built for cars, can safely accommodate pedestrians, cyclists, and tourists alike.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            So as life as we know it shifts towards a “new normal” how can we be equipped to live safely and happily in a 1.5-meter society? With tourists returning back to the streets of Amsterdam and Amsterdammers heading outside to enjoy their summer in their city we must create more space for people to do so safely. It is time for the city of Amsterdam to enact a stricter, comprehensive car ban that returns the streets to pedestrians and cyclists while encouraging social distancing and providing cleaner, healthier air to breath.

                            With 17 million people and 23 million bikes, there are way more bikes than people in the Netherlands. The good old bicycle is also the greatest source of crime in the Netherlands with, for example, over 8000 bicycles reported stolen in 2019 in Amsterdam alone. Though bike theft is somewhat inevitable, you can take the following steps to help deter bike thieves and prevent your main ride getting stolen.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            1.	Buy a strong bike: Don’t skimp out on buying a lock! Some Dutchies recommend buying a lock that is half of the value of your bike. Though it may seem ridiculous to spend just as much on your lock as you did on your bike, a strong lock is a huge deterrent to bike thieves. If you don’t want to deal with the hassle and heartbreak that a stolen bike brings, buy a solid lock.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            2.	Double lock: One strong lock may be enough to stop a thief in their tracks, but a second lock makes it much more difficult for your bike to be stolen. Double locking your bike makes it much more difficult and much less appealing to steal your bike!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            3.	Lock to a rack or pole: Once you have both of your locks, you are going to want to make sure that your bike is attached to a sturdy, stationary object like a bike rack, lamp post, or street sign pole. (Make sure you park in a legal space that is not blocking sidewalks or roads otherwise your bike may be removed from the city you live in).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            4.	Park somewhere well lit/visible: When locking your bike, especially at night, make sure you park it somewhere that is well lit. If you park it somewhere dark, it may be easier for the bike to be stolen because it is much less visible. Even better, if you can park your bike inside (storage closet, bike parking) it is even more safe from thieves looking to steal a bike!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            5.	HOPE FOR THE BEST: If you follow tips 1-4, all you can do is hope for the best! Sometimes a bit of un-luck is inevitable, but actively trying to prevent bike theft by responsibly locking and parking your bike will probably be enough to keep your bike safe!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Hopefully, by following these steps, you can avoid that horrible feeling of frantically searching for your bike only to come to the realization that it was stolen. That way, you can keep using that trusty-old-bicycle to explore the Netherlands the local way!

                                                    Amsterdam Wildlife, a documentary filmed in 2015, reveals the ways in which many species have been able to nestle and thrive in the bustling, bike city of Amsterdam. 
                            Urban ecologist Martin Melchers takes viewers through the many different, and diverse, ecosystems of Amsterdam and illustrates the resilience of many species and how they have learned to make Amsterdam their home despite the predominance of people.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Each of the ecosystems presented are human-made or have a prominent human presence, such as Amsterdam’s canals. Amsterdam Wildlife shows viewers 8 different ecosystems in Amsterdam, some of which are especially surprising: 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            1. Canals: The canals used to be filthy and filled with raw sewage. Today, Amsterdam’s canals are not only beautiful but also home to many different marine species such as the quoga mussel.  If you thought that Amsterdam’s canals were filled with forgotten bicycles, then think again! The quoga mussel is flourishing among other species such as the spired loach, killer shrimp, and bream fish.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            2. Gardens: There are just as many trees in Amsterdam as there are people, many of which are located in the private gardens of people’s homes. These gardens are home to different insects and birds such as the southern hawker dragonfly, small tortoise shell butterfly, and the great spotted woodpecker. Many bird species also use the crevices and tiles on the roofs of buildings to build nests, which are mostly undisturbed by people.
                            </p>

                            <div class="image-box">

                            </div>

          <p>             
3. Roofs: In addition to finding their way onto the roofs of homes, birds in Amsterdam such as the common tern (visdief) settle on the roofs of industrial buildings. These buildings, though built for and by people, are mostly free from any human disturbance and therefore serve as nests and safe havens, which allow different birds to flourish.

4. Harbor: In the sandy-dune edges of Afrikahaven harbor in Amsterdam, tucked away from massive cargo ships, you will find special bird species such as the common kingfisher and sand martin. Common kingfishers are stunningly beautiful birds with blue, turquoise and yellow coloring. The sand martin birds are migratory and fly from Africa each year to nest in the dunes near Amsterdam.

    5.  The Ij: The Ij host ships from all over the world that use the waterway to transport cargo to all over Europe. Massive cargo ships are filled with water from their location of origin as a mechanism to help the ships from wobbling. When these ships port, the water is emptied into the Ij. With that water, many different organisms are released into the Ij and some of these organisms end up making the Ij their new home. Species like the Asian snow crab dwarf crab, and red swamp crayfish are “exotic” species—though Melchers does not employ that term because these species are now very much at home. Melchers says that locals always voice concern about the introduction of these species into a new ecosystem. To that he responds that are not human beings also invasive species that have taken over and displaced other species?

                                6. Factory: Foxes are very much present in Amsterdam and have made a home for themselves near a concrete factory on the outskirts of Amsterdam. Foxes, though they are able to thrive so close to humans have to worry about getting hit by traffic. These playful animals spend most of their time outside of the foxhole, except immediately after birth, and typically hunt the common hare. The common hare “lives in its fur” and can endure the elements with almost no hesitation! Interestingly, if the mother hare dies the auntie hare will take over and raise the babies as her own.

                            7. Buildings: The fastest bird in the world, the peregrine falcon, also lives in Amsterdam. These birds like to nest high up and have been found on top of factory smokestacks and even on top of the Rabobank sign in Amsterdam Zuidas. These birds can catch a prey, like pigeons, mid-flight. However, like lions, when they are not hunting they are usually relaxing!

                            8. Forest: In the famous Amsterdamse Bos you will also be able to find grass snakes. Though the thought of stumbling upon a snake in a calm walk through the forest can be quite scary, these snakes are very shy because other than spraying a smelly liquid in the faces of predators they are indefensible. Many grass snakes do not survive as they fall victim to birds such as magpies and storks, but grass snakes have been found to group up to 1.2-1.33 meters long and 15 years old!

                            The Amsterdam Wildlife documentary delves deep into the different, and often marginal, places that animals in the Amsterdam-area find themselves. Though it appears that ducks and pigeons are the primary animals in Amsterdam, Amsterdam Wildlife shows that nature will flourish in any place that is untouched or unsettled by others.
