                            A city known for its abundance of bicycles has become equally known for its bustling tourism and crowded city center. Often, Amsterdammers ring their bike bells at tourists who find themselves blocking bike lanes and roads. Cyclists, dodging tourists who are unfamiliar with such a prominent cycling infrastructure, are often annoyed with tourists as they associate them with a crowded city center that is impossible to bike through. But, the association of tourists as the main source of congestion in the city center may be a false equivalence. The true culprit is the number of cars driving through narrow roads that were clearly not built for cars.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            However, despite the atrocities brought on by the COVID 19 pandemic, Amsterdammers have been able to find a silver lining: their streets are clear, the city is peaceful, and there is less noise. But, the obvious absence of tourists is not the only explanation for the improved accessibility of Amsterdam by locals. The absence of cars had arguably created more space for residents to roam and reclaim their streets. Cars, not tourists, are the greatest culprits of congestion in Amsterdam. City congestion, a nuisance to residents, is not the only reason Amsterdam should ditch cards.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Evidence shows that a decrease in road and air traffic could explain a decrease between 20-60% in CO2 emissions during the month of March. While fewer Dutch people were driving in compliance with stay-at-home orders, there was an improvement in air quality.  In 2019, the city of Amsterdam announced that it would ban gasoline and diesel powered cars and motorcycles beginning in 2030. The city’s current plan cites air quality as the main reason for initiating a car ban. We can see that the response to following stay-at-home instructions unintentionally reflected this very goal to decrease auto emissions. Auto emissions, which contribute to poor air quality only further exacerbate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Research shows that patients who live in an area with poorer air quality are more likely to die from the coronavirus. A swift ban on vehicles in the city center would especially make sense, in the short-term, given the relationship between poor air quality and coronavirus-related deaths.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            According to Amsterdam’s city traffic counselor, Sharon Dijksma, Amsterdammers’ lives are cut short by 1 year because of poor air quality, but cars also occupy limited, valuable space in Amsterdam. Not only do cars have negative implications for our health, but they occupy limited, valuable space in Amsterdam. Europeans, in general, want to reclaim their city’s streets from cars: A poll from politico found that, on average, 64% of European residents did not want to return to levels of pollution pre-pandemic. A car ban provides relief from air pollution and more space for residents to roam safely in their cities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The reclamation of city space from cars has been happening all over the world in an attempt to create more outdoor space for safe social distancing since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Cities such as Milan, Rome, Berlin, and New York, among many others, have all committed to expanding cycling infrastructure and prioritizing pedestrians and cyclists over cars. While Amsterdam already has an expansive cycling infrastructure with 515km of cycling lanes in the city, it is important that the city continues to class cyclists and pedestrians above cars.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The city of Amsterdam should implement its car ban immediately and should include all personal automobiles, not just gas and diesel vehicles. There are, obviously, some exceptions that should be made: people with disabilities who rely on personal vehicles to transport themselves should have access to permits that would allow personal vehicle use.  Additionally, delivery, construction, and commerce-related vehicles would also be able to access the city center. The current ban that allows electric vehicles gives a pass to wealthy city dwellers that can afford to switch to electric. Instead, this ban should be extensive so that Amsterdam’s narrow streets, which were never built for cars, can safely accommodate pedestrians, cyclists, and tourists alike.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            So as life as we know it shifts towards a “new normal” how can we be equipped to live safely and happily in a 1.5-meter society? With tourists returning back to the streets of Amsterdam and Amsterdammers heading outside to enjoy their summer in their city we must create more space for people to do so safely. It is time for the city of Amsterdam to enact a stricter, comprehensive car ban that returns the streets to pedestrians and cyclists while encouraging social distancing and providing cleaner, healthier air to breath.

                            With 17 million people and 23 million bikes, there are way more bikes than people in the Netherlands. The good old bicycle is also the greatest source of crime in the Netherlands with, for example, over 8000 bicycles reported stolen in 2019 in Amsterdam alone. Though bike theft is somewhat inevitable, you can take the following steps to help deter bike thieves and prevent your main ride getting stolen.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            1.	Buy a strong bike: Don’t skimp out on buying a lock! Some Dutchies recommend buying a lock that is half of the value of your bike. Though it may seem ridiculous to spend just as much on your lock as you did on your bike, a strong lock is a huge deterrent to bike thieves. If you don’t want to deal with the hassle and heartbreak that a stolen bike brings, buy a solid lock.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            2.	Double lock: One strong lock may be enough to stop a thief in their tracks, but a second lock makes it much more difficult for your bike to be stolen. Double locking your bike makes it much more difficult and much less appealing to steal your bike!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            3.	Lock to a rack or pole: Once you have both of your locks, you are going to want to make sure that your bike is attached to a sturdy, stationary object like a bike rack, lamp post, or street sign pole. (Make sure you park in a legal space that is not blocking sidewalks or roads otherwise your bike may be removed from the city you live in).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            4.	Park somewhere well lit/visible: When locking your bike, especially at night, make sure you park it somewhere that is well lit. If you park it somewhere dark, it may be easier for the bike to be stolen because it is much less visible. Even better, if you can park your bike inside (storage closet, bike parking) it is even more safe from thieves looking to steal a bike!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            5.	HOPE FOR THE BEST: If you follow tips 1-4, all you can do is hope for the best! Sometimes a bit of un-luck is inevitable, but actively trying to prevent bike theft by responsibly locking and parking your bike will probably be enough to keep your bike safe!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Hopefully, by following these steps, you can avoid that horrible feeling of frantically searching for your bike only to come to the realization that it was stolen. That way, you can keep using that trusty-old-bicycle to explore the Netherlands the local way!

                                                    Amsterdam Wildlife, a documentary filmed in 2015, reveals the ways in which many species have been able to nestle and thrive in the bustling, bike city of Amsterdam. 
                            Urban ecologist Martin Melchers takes viewers through the many different, and diverse, ecosystems of Amsterdam and illustrates the resilience of many species and how they have learned to make Amsterdam their home despite the predominance of people.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Each of the ecosystems presented are human-made or have a prominent human presence, such as Amsterdam’s canals. Amsterdam Wildlife shows viewers 8 different ecosystems in Amsterdam, some of which are especially surprising: 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            1. Canals: The canals used to be filthy and filled with raw sewage. Today, Amsterdam’s canals are not only beautiful but also home to many different marine species such as the quoga mussel.  If you thought that Amsterdam’s canals were filled with forgotten bicycles, then think again! The quoga mussel is flourishing among other species such as the spired loach, killer shrimp, and bream fish.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            2. Gardens: There are just as many trees in Amsterdam as there are people, many of which are located in the private gardens of people’s homes. These gardens are home to different insects and birds such as the southern hawker dragonfly, small tortoise shell butterfly, and the great spotted woodpecker. Many bird species also use the crevices and tiles on the roofs of buildings to build nests, which are mostly undisturbed by people.
                            </p>

                                margin-bottom: 10px;

                                }
                            </style>
          <p>             
3. Roofs: In addition to finding their way onto the roofs of homes, birds in Amsterdam such as the common tern (visdief) settle on the roofs of industrial buildings. These buildings, though built for and by people, are mostly free from any human disturbance and therefore serve as nests and safe havens, which allow different birds to flourish.
</p>
<p>
4. Harbor: In the sandy-dune edges of Afrikahaven harbor in Amsterdam, tucked away from massive cargo ships, you will find special bird species such as the common kingfisher and sand martin. Common kingfishers are stunningly beautiful birds with blue, turquoise and yellow coloring. The sand martin birds are migratory and fly from Africa each year to nest in the dunes near Amsterdam.

                            <p>
    5.  The Ij: The Ij host ships from all over the world that use the waterway to transport cargo to all over Europe. Massive cargo ships are filled with water from their location of origin as a mechanism to help the ships from wobbling. When these ships port, the water is emptied into the Ij. With that water, many different organisms are released into the Ij and some of these organisms end up making the Ij their new home. Species like the Asian snow crab dwarf crab, and red swamp crayfish are “exotic” species—though Melchers does not employ that term because these species are now very much at home. Melchers says that locals always voice concern about the introduction of these species into a new ecosystem. To that he responds that are not human beings also invasive species that have taken over and displaced other species?

                            </p>

                                6. Factory: Foxes are very much present in Amsterdam and have made a home for themselves near a concrete factory on the outskirts of Amsterdam. Foxes, though they are able to thrive so close to humans have to worry about getting hit by traffic. These playful animals spend most of their time outside of the foxhole, except immediately after birth, and typically hunt the common hare. The common hare “lives in its fur” and can endure the elements with almost no hesitation! Interestingly, if the mother hare dies the auntie hare will take over and raise the babies as her own.

                            7. Buildings: The fastest bird in the world, the peregrine falcon, also lives in Amsterdam. These birds like to nest high up and have been found on top of factory smokestacks and even on top of the Rabobank sign in Amsterdam Zuidas. These birds can catch a prey, like pigeons, mid-flight. However, like lions, when they are not hunting they are usually relaxing!

                            8. Forest: In the famous Amsterdamse Bos you will also be able to find grass snakes. Though the thought of stumbling upon a snake in a calm walk through the forest can be quite scary, these snakes are very shy because other than spraying a smelly liquid in the faces of predators they are indefensible. Many grass snakes do not survive as they fall victim to birds such as magpies and storks, but grass snakes have been found to group up to 1.2-1.33 meters long and 15 years old!

                            The Amsterdam Wildlife documentary delves deep into the different, and often marginal, places that animals in the Amsterdam-area find themselves. Though it appears that ducks and pigeons are the primary animals in Amsterdam, Amsterdam Wildlife shows that nature will flourish in any place that is untouched or unsettled by others.
